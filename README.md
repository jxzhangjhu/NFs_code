1. Sep 7, 2018 - [`FrEIA`](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) by [VLL Heidelberg](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn) ![GitHub repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/VLL-HD/FrEIA)

   > The Framework for Easily Invertible Architectures (FrEIA) is based on RNVP flows. Easy to setup, it allows to define complex Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) from simple invertible building blocks.

2. Feb 9, 2020 - [`nflows`](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows) by [Bayesiains](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/group) ![GitHub repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bayesiains/nflows)

   > A suite of most of the SOTA methods using PyTorch. From an ML group in Edinburgh. They created the current SOTA spline flows. Almost as complete as you'll find from a single repo.
