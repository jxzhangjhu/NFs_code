    > Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target
distribution and have proved to be powerful models for data generation and density
estimation. In this work, we propose a novel type of normalizing flow driven
by a differential deformation of the Wiener process. As a result, we obtain a
rich time series model whose observable process inherits many of the appealing
properties of its base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and
marginals. Furthermore, our continuous treatment provides a natural framework for
irregular time series with an independent arrival process, including straightforward
interpolation. We illustrate the desirable properties of the proposed model on
popular stochastic processes and demonstrate its superior flexibility to variational
RNN and latent ODE baselines in a series of experiments on synthetic and realworld data.
